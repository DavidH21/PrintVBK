# PrintVBK
Did you order a book promising you a PDF but instead got a VBK? Well, I did and was not pleased. I created this program to automated the printing process and wanted to share it. This program could be made better and I have more ideas on how I can improve this but seeing as I'm the only who is using it, I don't see a need to improve it unless I get more people asking to.
